    ellen @ say "Good morning everyone. Today we'll be finishing up The Death of Ivan Ilyich. I'll be sad to see him go but we have plenty of other great books to get through and so little time."
    ellen @ say "After Ivan falls and injures his side, he suffers from worsening pain that causes him to become irritable and further destabilize his relationship with his family."
    ellen @ say "His condition eventually leaves him bedridden and unable to work. Faced with both his mortality and the loss of his sense of purpose, he reflects on what it truly means to die."
    ellen @ say "He comes to realize that the perception of death revolves around the fulfillment of life one has made for themself."
    ellen @ say "He had once believed he led a fulfilling life by acquiring prestige and status, but as he lay dying, none of his achievements mattered so much as the sympathy he received from his servant."
    ellen @ say "Moved by its sheer authenticity, Ivan finally understood while on his deathbed that by pursuing his own interests, he had neglected to foster a caring family."
    ellen @ say "Their relationship resembled that of business partners, where one is only good for the convenience and profits they bring in, but by this time Ivan was nothing but dead weight."
    ellen @ say "His existence brought about an impersonal and artificial partnership that could only acknowledge each other as far as how one benefitted the other."
