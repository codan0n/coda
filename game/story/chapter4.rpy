#chapter 4

#to do
    #add autumn backgrounds
    #color more backgrounds (add watercolor to lecture hall)
    #revise ch 1-3 to add more contextual stuff and cut out fluff
    #draw teacher and nurse sprites
    #porcupine cameo?
    #add mini scenes like claire's coffee date (she gets honey and salt latte)
    
#midterms are on thursday/friday so you have to hunker down on studying, but some distractions are in play
#history exam has an extra credit question about dinosaurs
#miss ellen asks if you're doing anything during the break and might ask you to come over. either way you get her number and start texting (later on you not ellen and miss ellen have the same number)
#after midterms, gunner, ava and claire go home for fall break
#rory taunts rori for not coming home
#can either walk around playing pokemon go with rori or creative writing with mishka
#find out rose lives next door to you
#later get stuck in a power outage in the dorms until you find the breaker and flip it with rose. can't use fire escape or it will set off the sprinklers and ruin everything
#when gunner comes back, he's in shock at all the rats rori has collected in their dorm
#get grades back, see what you need to work on
#chapter ends with skipping class to hang out with ava and claire, then having a medical episode and finding your true diagnosis
